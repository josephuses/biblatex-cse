biblatex-cse
============

This is a biblatex style package based on Scientific Style and Format: The CSE Manual for Authors, Editors, and Publishers (7th ed.), a publication of the Council of Science Editors.

There are still a lot to do with this package. Some of them are:
In-text citations:
1. For two authors, make in-text citation as (Author1 and Autho2 YYYY)
2. For three or more authors (Author1 et al. YYYY)
Bibliography:
Automate the following.
1. Make cited references be printed under "CITED REFERENCES"
2. Make references not cited be printed under "OTHER REFERENCES"
